About Project
=============

This project is about creating a robot with the below hover effects:

1. Body parts move as a response to mouse hover
2. Robot moves forward creating a shadow on mouse hover


The robot also has an animation effect of moving around the screen when the page is loaded.

Properties newly launched in CSS3 have been used e.g. CSS transition , tranform and animation.

Flex-box is used to position the various parts of the robot in order along with other position properties , also the ones from the box-model concept.

Z-Index property is used to position the shadow and the robot.


The webpage with robot is fully responsive.


Technology Used
===============

HTML5
CSS3
Google fonts
Sublime Text 3
Git


Code Editor
============

Sublime Text3




Challenges
==========

1. The main challenge is to position the parts of the robot in correct order.
2. Figuring out how to reuse the code to maximum for creating the shadow (i still believe that the code can be refactored even better.)




Compatibility issues
====================

The code has been tested on Google Chrome Version 90.0.4430.85

Because of the use of some properties from CSS3 , some effects might not be working for some browser versions.
If in doubt use the css file "compatibilityModified_robot_style.css" instead of "robot_style.css".
